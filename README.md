# All Reduce with Multiple Algorithms
AllReduce is an operation that reduces the target arrays in all processes to a single array and returns the resultant array to all processes.Â  In this project, I implemented SUM AllReduce (Commonly used in DL to compute the mean of gradients) in four ways: Brute Force, Butterfly, Tree and Ring AllReduce. These algorithms were proposed to accommodate complex cross-node network environment such as bandwidth limits.
